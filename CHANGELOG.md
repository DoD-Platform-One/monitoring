Leave empty with sso.enabled = true to place the haproxy+authservice injection in front of alertmanager/prometheus. Fill in with your own service/port if customizing the installation/services.

### Changed
- Prometheus+Alertmanager VirtualServices pointing directly to the UIs will be skipped and not created when "sso.enabled: true"
