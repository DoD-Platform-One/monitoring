# Code Changes for Updates

Monitoring is a modified/customized version of an upstream chart. The below details the steps required to update to a new version of the Monitoring package.

1. Navigate to the [upstream chart repo and folder](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) and find the tag that corresponds with the new chart version for this image update. For example, if updating the Prometheus image to 2.31.1 you would check the [chart values](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/kube-prometheus-stack-23.1.6/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml#L2069) and switch Gitlab tags (naming syntax is `kube-prometheus-stack-*`) until you find the latest chart version that uses the 2.31.1 Prometheus image. Start with the newest chart version to make sure we get the latest patches.

2. Validate that the other images required by this chart version are ready and available in Ironbank. Look at the previous releases `images.txt` to get the list of images and search through the values file to find what the new versions are.

3. Checkout the `renovate/ironbank` branch. This branch will already have most of the updates you need for the images.

4. From the root of the repo run `kpt pkg update chart@kube-prometheus-stack-23.1.6 --strategy alpha-git-patch` replacing `kube-prometheus-stack-23.1.6` with the version tag you got in step 1. You may be prompted to resolve some conflicts - choose what makes sense (if there are BB additions/changes keep them, if there are upstream additions/changes keep them).

5. Modify the `version` in `Chart.yaml` - you will want to append `-bb.0` to the chart version from upstream.

6. Update `CHANGELOG.md` adding an entry for the new version and noting all changes (at minimum should include `Updated Monitoring chart to x.x.x` and `Updated image versions to latest in IB (P: x.x.x G: x.x.x A: x.x.x)` with the versions for Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager).

7. Run `helm dependency update chart` from the root of the project. This ensures that the latest subchart versions are pulled in and packaged as `tgz` for airgap.

8. Generate the `README.md` updates by following the [guide in gluon](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/library-charts/gluon/-/blob/master/docs/bb-package-readme.md).

9. Push up your changes, validate that CI passes. If there are any failures follow the information in the pipeline to make the necessary updates and reach out to the team if needed.

10. Perform the steps below for manual testing. CI provides a good set of basic smoke tests but it is beneficial to run some additional checks.

## Manual Testing for Updates

NOTE: For these testing steps it is good to do them on both a clean install and an upgrade. For clean install, point monitoring to your branch. For an upgrade do an install with monitoring pointing to the latest tag, then perform a helm upgrade with monitoring pointing to your branch.

You will want to install with:

- Monitoring, Jaeger, Kiali, and Authservice packages enabled
- Istio enabled
- [Dev SSO values](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/bigbang/-/blob/master/chart/dev-sso-values.yaml) for Kiali, Monitoring, and Jaeger

Testing Steps:

- Login with SSO to Prometheus (if you are not prompted for an SSO login, this could indicate a problem with the authservice connection), check the Status -> Targets page and validate that all targets show as up
- Login with SSO to Alertmanager and validate that alerts are firing (if the main page shows no alert groups check the Prometheus logs and see if there are errors with that connection)
- Login with SSO to Grafana and take a look at some dashboards, validate that data is loaded
- Login to Kiali and go to applications, pick monitoring namespace and prometheus for the application, validate that there is data in some of the inbound/outbound metrics fields - also validate Kiali is showing no red bells on the top bar (this could indicate connection issues with Prometheus/Grafana)

When in doubt with any testing or upgrade steps ask one of the CODEOWNERS for assistance.
