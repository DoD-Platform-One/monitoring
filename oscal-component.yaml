          Privileged events, including updating the deployment of an application, or use of privileged containers
          are collected as metrics by prometheus and displayed by Grafana

          API endpoints suitable for capturing application level metrics are present on each of the supported applications running as containers.  In addition, system and cluster level metrics are emitted by containers with read only access to host level information.

          Metrics are captured and stored by Prometheus, an web server capable of scraping endpoints formatted in the appropriate dimensional data format.  Metrics information is stored on disk in a time series data base, and later queried through a separate component providing a web interface for the query language: PromQL.

          Prometheus is the log aggregator for audit logs since it is used to scrape/collect violations from ClusterAuditor.  The storage capability can be configured in prometheus to use PVCs to ensure metrics have log retention complioance with the org-defined audit-log retention requirements

          Alertmanager has pre-build alerts for failed pods that would show when ClusterAuditor is not processeing events, or 
          prometheus is unable to scrape events.

          Prometheus also has a deadman's alert to ensure end users are seeing events from prometheus as part of its configuration

          Grafana has the ability to provide Role Based Access Control to limit the data sources that end users can view by leveraging an
          identity provider.  Grafana can also limit users to subsets of metrics within a datasource by the use of Label Based Acces Control
          when using Grafana Enterprise.

          Prometheus can scrape external components outside of the system, but this configuration is not easily supported as part of
          the current big bang configuration of ClusterAuditor since external access to ClusterAuditor metrics is not exposed via
          Istio
